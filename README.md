# Unity 3D Action Adventure Game

A third-person action-adventure game built with Unity featuring player movement, inventory system, dialogue interactions, and consumable items with dynamic effects.

I recommend trying the Item Editor window, which you can access through Unity’s Tools menu. It’s an excellent way for designers to comfortably create new items or modify existing ones.
Also, make sure to try the inventory’s debug menu, you can use it to give yourself potions that affect the character’s speed, jump height, or size. It’s a great way to see how dynamic the character animations truly are.
